# PythonHTTPv2
Python HTTPv2 client and server

Note: Hyper-python does'nt run on python3.10, either downgrade your python if you get an error, or try to change collections to collections.abc wherever yoy get error as done for this project, this and any other erors that arise are fairly well document and you should be able to do the migration to 3.10 yourselves without many issues

Also note: Please generate a ssl cert using certbot and a private key to run this code, most httpv2 libs seem to be giving cryptic errors without ssl
